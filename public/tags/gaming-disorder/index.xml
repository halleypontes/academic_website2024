      <title>Assessing Internet Gaming Disorder - insights from our latest research</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2024-10-p2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/2024-10-p2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the conversation around Gaming Disorder has gained significant traction, especially as more people recognise
the impact of excessive gaming on mental health. In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2024.100567&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt;, we took a closer look at two of the most widely used assessment
tools for GD: the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.12.006&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short-Form (IGDS9-SF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and
the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-019-00088-z&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gaming Disorder Test (GDT)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Our goal was to evaluate how well these tools measure
disordered gaming and what that means for individuals and clinicians alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-gaming-disorder&#34;&gt;What is Gaming Disorder?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/frequently-asked-questions/gaming-disorder&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gaming Disorder&lt;/a&gt; is a condition recognized in
the World Health Organisation&amp;rsquo;s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).
It involves a pattern of gaming behaviour where a person struggles to control their gaming habits, prioritises gaming over other
important activities and interests, and continues to play even when it leads to negative effects in their life.
Essentially, it means that gaming becomes more important than other aspects of daily living, which can harm a person&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-our-study&#34;&gt;About our study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, we gathered a diverse group of 605 participants, all of whom were Spanish-speaking individuals aged between 16 and 73 years
who played video games at least once a week. Through an online survey, we assessed the reliability and effectiveness of the IGDS9-SF and GDT
in identifying symptoms of disordered gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using advanced statistical methods, we analysed the data to determine whether these two scales accurately measure a single underlying trait
(i.e., disordered gaming) and how well they can distinguish between different levels of severity. Accurately measuring Gaming Disorder is
crucial for identifying and treating individuals who may be struggling with excessive gaming and understanding the severity of their issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-key-findings&#34;&gt;Our key findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our most significant findings was that both the IGDS9-SF and GDT are unidimensional. This means that each scale effectively measures
one core aspect of Gaming Disorder. The results showed that the items (which represent the unique symptoms of Gaming Disorder) on both scales
work well together to reflect the same underlying issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, both scales demonstrated high reliability, which means that they consistently provide accurate measurements of Gaming Disorder symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also explored how well the items of each scale can differentiate between varying levels of Gaming Disorder. We found that the GDT performed
particularly well, achieving a strong scalability coefficient, which suggests that its items are effective at distinguishing between
individuals with different levels of gaming issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found a clear hierarchy of item difficulty within both scales. For instance, in the IGDS9-SF, the most challenging item related
to the experience of &lt;strong&gt;negative consequences of gaming&lt;/strong&gt;, while the easiest item was about &lt;strong&gt;escapism&lt;/strong&gt;, which means that when assessing
Gaming Disorder, it is important to understand that the potential negative consequences resulting from excessive gaming is a much better
indicator of Gaming Disorder than playing video games excessively to escape real-life problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the GDT, the most difficult item involved &lt;strong&gt;experiencing significant life problems&lt;/strong&gt; due to gaming, which is highly consistent with the
findings of the IGDS9-SF. Interestingly, the easiest item was related to giving &lt;strong&gt;increased priority to gaming&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an important sign
of Gaming Disorder but certainly not as critical compared to the detrimental consequences excessive gaming can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found that &lt;strong&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; (in IGDS9-SF) and &lt;strong&gt;experience of significant problems in life&lt;/strong&gt; (in GDT) were the most discriminative
items. This finding suggests that these two symptoms are particularly effective in differentiating individuals experiencing Gaming Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;implications-of-our-findings&#34;&gt;Implications of our findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of our study are important for both individuals and mental health professionals. Firstly, it is important to pay attention
to more critical symptoms as these may require a greater level of intervention. One of the critical symptoms we identified relates to the
negative impact of excessive gaming on a person&amp;rsquo;s life (e.g., missing real-life opportunities, skipping school, missing work, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the most discriminative items were: &lt;strong&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; in the IGDS9-SF and the &lt;strong&gt;experience of significant life problems&lt;/strong&gt; in
the GDT. These two symptoms should be prioritised during assessments and clinicians should pay close attention to them as they appear to indicate
a more severe form of Gaming Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our findings suggest that the GDT may be slightly more effective than the IGDS9-SF in distinguishing between individuals with high
and low levels of Gaming Disorder, a finding that can help guide health practitioners in selecting the most appropriate assessment tool for their
clinical work with clients struggling with Gaming Disorder, ultimately leading to better targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our study supports the psychometric robustness of both the IGDS9-SF and GDT, confirming their utility in both research and
clinical settings for assessing Gaming Disorder. By utilising these tools, researchers and clinicians can better identify individuals at
risk for Gaming Disorder and implement more focussed interventions aimed at treating this condition and promoting healthier gaming behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the conversation around gaming and mental health continues to evolve, our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that can help
shape effective strategies for prevention and intervention in the realm of Gaming Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding professional gaming, gaming disorder, and functional impairments</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2024-04-p1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/2024-04-p1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a previous &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.06.003&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we initiated a line of inquiry into the complex association between functional gaming-related functional impairments in individuals potentially experiencing Gaming Disorder (GD). This initial study found that the areas mostly affected by functional impairments were &lt;em&gt;‘school and/or work’&lt;/em&gt;, followed by &lt;em&gt;‘psychological health’&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;‘family’&lt;/em&gt;-related functional impairments. Interestingly, it also found that the least affected area related to &lt;em&gt;‘friends’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this initial investigation, we have conducted a follow-up study narrowing the scope of the analysis. In our most recent follow-up &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56358-x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; published in the journal &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/srep/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we provided a glimpse on the challenges faced by Professional Gamers (PGs) compared to their Non-Professional Gamers (NPGs). We analyzed a sample of 5,198 English-speaking gamers to help us understand the prevalence of GD and associated functional impairments within these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of GD, officially recognized by the World Health Organization, refers to a pattern of gaming behavior characterized by impaired control, prioritization of gaming over other interests, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite negative consequences. Our findings revealed that PGs exhibited a significantly higher risk for GD—with prevalence rates almost double those of NPGs. This elevated risk is mirrored by an increased symptom-load and more hours spent gaming weekly among PGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked if they had experienced a significant problem due to gaming, PGs reported experiencing more problems compared to NPGs. While the single most predominant area of life affected by gaming-related functional impairments reported by both groups was &lt;em&gt;‘school and/work’&lt;/em&gt;, the second most prevalent for PGs was &lt;em&gt;‘family’&lt;/em&gt; while for NPGs it was &lt;em&gt;‘physical health’&lt;/em&gt;. Interestingly, the third most predominant area of life affected among PGs was &lt;em&gt;‘physical health’&lt;/em&gt; while for NPGs it was &lt;em&gt;‘family’&lt;/em&gt;. In relation to other variables of interest examined in our study, PGs showed higher levels of functional impairments compared to NPG only in relation to overall &lt;em&gt;‘psychiatric distress’&lt;/em&gt; and severity of &lt;em&gt;‘insomnia’&lt;/em&gt; with no meaningful differences emerging in relation to &lt;em&gt;‘loneliness’&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;‘attention problems’&lt;/em&gt;, and severity of &lt;em&gt;‘headache experiences’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study findings support a holistic approach to GD diagnosis, considering functional impairments as a crucial factor. For clinicians and health professionals, understanding the specific areas of life affected by GD can enhance treatment efforts, ultimately improving the quality of life for those impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of competitive esports, where the line between passion and compulsion can blur, the insights generate by our study not only contribute to our understanding of GD but also emphasize the critical role of industry-led initiatives in safeguarding the wellbeing of gamers. As we move forward, collaboration between researchers, health professionals, and industry stakeholders will be key in developing comprehensive strategies to address the challenges highlighted by this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us continue this conversation and work together towards a healthier gaming community. Follow me on social media for real-time updates and discussions on the future of gaming and mental health. Together, we can navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital age, ensuring that gaming remains a source of joy and innovation, not distress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigating the interplay between gaming disorder and functional impairments in professional esports gaming</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2024/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Gaming Disorder (GD) and the experience of functional impairments
has received considerable theoretical attention in the recent past and current diagnostic
approaches underscore the centrality of functional impairments as a requirement for GD diagnosis.
However, there is limited empirical evidence illuminating the interplay between GD and functional
impairments, particularly among specific vulnerable groups. The present study seeks to bridge this
gap by investigating an English-speaking sample (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 5198) comprising an age- and gender-matched
group of Professional Gamers (PG, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2599) and Non-Professional Gamers (NPG, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2599) sub-sampled
from a larger sample of 192,260 individuals. The results revealed that PG were at a greater risk
for GD compared to NPG as the prevalence rate of GD among PG (3.31%) was significantly higher and
almost doubled that of NPG (1.73%), with PG further exhibiting higher overall GD symptom-load and
weekly time spent gaming compared to NPG. Furthermore, PG reported experiencing significantly higher
frequency of gaming-related functional impairments compared to NPG, with the in particular affected
areas for both PG and NPG being &lt;em&gt;‘school and/or work’&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;‘physical health’&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;‘family’&lt;/em&gt;, with other key
differences emerging in relation to other outcomes. Overall, the present findings show that not only
GD symptom-load but also some functional impairment is higher in PG compared to NPG which highlights
the need to develop and support prevention and intervention strategies for this at-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The interplay between time spent gaming and disordered gaming: A large-scale world-wide study</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/publication/2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: ‘Gaming Disorder’ (GD) is now an officially recognized mental health disorder according
to the World Health Organization (WHO) framework while ‘Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) remains as
a tentative disorder as per the American Psychiatric Association (APA) framework. Although both GD
and IGD reflect disordered gaming tendencies marked by excessive time spent gaming, little is known
about the extent to which too much time spent gaming becomes particularly problematic. Moreover, emerging
research has highlighted the need to further explore how both disordered gaming frameworks perform in
the assessment and estimation of disordered gaming symptoms and related behaviors. Methods: The primary
aim of the present study was to shed light on the complex relationship between time spent gaming and
disordered gaming and to provide prevalence estimates of disordered gaming across the WHO and APA frameworks.
This study adopted an online survey methodology and a cross-sectional design in a large sample of 123,262
eligible gamers from 168 countries. Results: The results obtained indicated that the prevalence rate
of disordered gaming among the participants was smaller when assessed with the WHO framework (i.e., 1.96%)
in comparison to the APA framework (i.e., 4.97%). Additionally, the relationship between time spent gaming
and disordered gaming varied, and disordered gaming was associated on average with 34.53 h of gaming a
week within the APA framework (i.e., with at least five criteria endorsed; higher gaming-time-averages
for those endorsing more criteria) and an average of 40.13 h a week within the WHO framework (i.e., with all
criteria endorsed). Conclusions: The relationship between weekly time spent gaming and disordered gaming is
multifaceted and varies according to the diagnostic framework adopted. The results highlight the need for
further refinement at the diagnostic level in regard to disordered gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measurement and Conceptualization of Gaming Disorder According to the World Health Organization Framework:the Development of the Gaming Disorder Test</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/publication/2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research on gaming disorder (GD) has highlighted key methodological and conceptual
hindrances stemming from the heterogeneity of nomenclature and the use of non-standardized
psychometric tools to assess this phenomenon. The recent recognition of GD as an official mental
health disorder and behavioral addiction by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 11th
Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) opens up new possibilities to
investigate further the psychosocial and mental health implications due to excessive and disordered
gaming. However, before further research on GD can be conducted in a reliable way and within a robust
cross-cultural context, a valid and reliable standardized psychometric tool to assess the construct as
defined by the WHO should be developed. The aim of this study was to develop The Gaming Disorder
Test (GDT), a brief four-item measure to assess GD and to further explore its psychometric properties.
A sample of 236 Chinese (47% male, mean age 19.22 years, SD = 1.57) and 324 British (49.4% male, mean
age 26.74 years, SD = 7.88) gamers was recruited online. Construct validity of the GDT was examined
via factorial validity, nomological validity, alongside convergent and discriminant validity. Concurrent
validity was also examined using the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale—Short-Form (IGDS9-SF). Finally, reliability
indicators involving the Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability coefficients were estimated. Overall,
the results indicated that GDT is best conceptualized within a single-factor structure. Additionally, the
four items of the GDT are valid, reliable, and proved to be highly suitable for measuring GD within a
cross-cultural context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A new era for gaming disorder research: Time to shift from consensus to consistency</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2020-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of the first commercial video games occurred in the early 1970s and it took approximately 10 years
for the first reports of what we would now term ‘Gaming Disorder’ (GD) to emerge in the scientific literature
(Ross, Finestone, &amp;amp; Lavin, 1982). More recently, research on GD has received much public and scientific scrutiny
due to the increasing importance given to this condition by official medical and psychiatric organizations
(Pontes &amp;amp; Griffiths, 2014). This led to three key milestones in the field. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.106059&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[continued&amp;hellip;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigating the differential effects of social networking site addiction and Internet gaming disorder on psychological health</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/publication/2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background and aims: Previous studies focused on examining the interrelationships between social
networking site (SNS) addiction and Internet gaming disorder (IGD) in isolation. Moreover, little
is known about the potential simultaneous differential effects of SNS addiction and IGD on psychological
health. This study investigated the interplay between these two technological addictions and ascertained
how they can uniquely and distinctively contribute to increasing psychiatric distress when accounting for
potential effects stemming from sociodemographic and technology-related variables. Methods: A sample of
509 adolescents (53.5% males) aged 10–18 years (mean = 13.02, SD = 1.64) were recruited. Results: It was
found that key demographic variables can play a distinct role in explaining SNS addiction and IGD. Furthermore,
it was found that SNS addiction and IGD can augment the symptoms of each other, and simultaneously contribute
to deterioration of overall psychological health in a similar fashion, further highlighting potentially common
etiological and clinical course between these two phenomena. Finally, the detrimental effects of IGD on psychological
health were found to be slightly more pronounced than those produced by SNS addiction, a finding that warrants
additional scientific scrutiny. Discussion and conclusion: The implications of these results are further discussed
in light of the existing evidence and debates regarding the status of technological addictions as primary and
secondary disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Conceptualisation and Measurement of DSM-5 Internet Gaming Disorder: The Development of the IGD-20 Test</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/publication/2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: Over the last decade, there has been growing concern about ‘gaming addiction’ and
its widely documented detrimental impacts on a minority of individuals that play excessively. The latest
(fifth) edition of the American Psychiatric Association&amp;rsquo;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-5) included nine criteria for the potential diagnosis of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD)
and noted that it was a condition that warranted further empirical study. Aim: The main aim of this study
was to develop a valid and reliable standardised psychometrically robust tool in addition to providing
empirically supported cut-off points. Methods: A sample of 1003 gamers (85.2% males; mean age 26 years)
from 57 different countries were recruited via online gaming forums. Validity was assessed by confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA), criterion-related validity, and concurrent validity. Latent profile analysis was also
carried to distinguish disordered gamers from non-disordered gamers. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were
performed to determine an empirical cut-off for the test. Results: The CFA confirmed the viability of
IGD-20 Test with a six-factor structure (salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict
and relapse) for the assessment of IGD according to the nine criteria from DSM-5. The IGD-20 Test proved
to be valid and reliable. According to the latent profile analysis, 5.3% of the total participants were
classed as disordered gamers. Additionally, an optimal empirical cut-off of 71 points (out of 100) seemed
to be adequate according to the sensitivity and specificity analyses carried. Conclusions: The present
findings support the viability of the IGD-20 Test as an adequate standardised psychometrically robust tool
for assessing internet gaming disorder. Consequently, the new instrument represents the first step towards
unification and consensus in the field of gaming studies.&lt;/p&gt;

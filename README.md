## 📚 About my repository

Welcome to the new repository of my new academic website! Here, you will find all the
resources, documentation, and code necessary to replicate the website if you wish.

## 🌟 The integrated [**Hugo Blox**](https://hugoblox.com) website builder and CMS makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free. Edit your site in the CMS (or your favorite editor), generate it with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and deploy with GitHub or Netlify. Customize anything on your site with widgets, light/dark themes, and language packs.

title: Keynote talk on Gaming Disorder at the Universidade Católica Portuguesa in Porto (Portugal)
---

It was a great honour to deliver a keynote talk on Gaming Disorder this month at the **I Jornadas
[CUP](https://fep.porto.ucp.pt/en/about/social-responsibility/cup-university-psychology-clinic?change-language=1)**
event that was organised by colleagues from [Universidade Católica Portuguesa in Porto (Portugal)](https://www.porto.ucp.pt).

The event itself provided an excellent opportunity to speak with local psychologists (researchers and clinicians)
doing some really inspiring work in Portugal across different areas of psychology.

The audience was vibrant, highly engaged, and interested on the issue of behavioural addictions. With many interesting questions
being asked!

It is great to see that professionals in Portugal now appear to be more aware and open to the issue of gaming disorder
and behavioural addictions more broadly. This is indeed a much different reality than back in 2011 when I was conducting the
first studies in this field in Portugal.

I would like to thank my colleagues from Universidade Católica Portuguesa in Porto and in particular
Prof. Dr. Lurdes Veríssimo for inviting me to this important event and all other colleagues who organised the event.

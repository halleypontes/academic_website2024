title: Assessment of Gaming Disorder with the IGDS9-SF
---
Hello everyone,

I was pleased to see that a recent study published by Anthony and colleagues (2022) in the journal **[Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice](https://doi.org/10.1037/cps0000123)** provided further insights on the psychometric properties and usability of the **Internet Disorder Scale-Short Form (IDS9-SF)**, which was the first brief standardized assessment tool for 'Internet Gaming Disorder' as defined in the DSM-5.

The IGDS9-SF was published in December 2014 in the journal **[Computers in Human Behavior](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.12.006)**, and after nearly a decade since its publication and numerous studies supporting its use worldwide, a new study provided further support to previous research.

Upon evaluating a set of 22 psychometric tests measuring 'Internet Gaming Disorder', Anthony and colleagues (2022) reported that:

>_Among all reviewed measures, the IGDS9-SF has been evaluated by the highest number of empirical studies (n = 26). In contrast, all other measures were evaluated by only a few studies (ns = 1â€“5)._

They further noted that:

>_Based on the COSMIN guideline, the IGDS9-SF demonstrates sound structural validity, internal consistency reliability, construct validity (convergent and divergent validities), test-retest reliability, and measurement invariance among gender, age groups (including three studies evaluating measurement invariance between adolescent and adult samples), and regions with moderate- to high methodological quality._

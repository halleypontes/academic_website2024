Welcome aboard!

I am really excited to release the new version of my website, which was developed using **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)** and **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**.

I hope we can keep connected and that I have enough time to keep you posted about my work.

In the meantime, I wish you all a truly awesome happy new year!

Stay tuned and follow me on **[Mastodon](https://metalhead.club/@DrHalleyPontes)** for real-time updates on what's happening!

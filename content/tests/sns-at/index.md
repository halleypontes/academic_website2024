title: Social Networking Sites - Addiction Test (SNS-AT)
---
The Social Networking Sites - Addiction Test (SNS-AT) **[(Montag, Müller, Pontes et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-023-01342-9)** was developed to provide a brief and convenient psychometric assessment framework for Social Media Addiction according to the widely supported _components model of addiction_ **[(Griffiths, 2005)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14659890500114359)** that includes salience, tolerance, mood modification, relapse, withdrawal, and conflict in line with current diagnostic criteria for addictive behaviors. The SNS-AT was also developed with the intent to provide a more current and revised assessment of Social Media Addiction by providing additional improvements to the wording and content of existing similar tools.

At the psychometric level, the SNS-AT has been found to be reliable and to offer a unidimensional factor structure for the measurement of Social Media Addiction via 6 items that capture the key symptoms of Social Media Addiction as reported in the literature. The SNS-AT was originally developed in a sample of 1,151 individuals (about 50% males and 50% females, with a large age range, starting with 18 years).

The SNS-AT has been shown to exhibit adequate psychometric validity in the initial study assessing its factorial validity via Confirmatory Factor Analysis **[(see Montag, Müller, Pontes et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-023-01342-9)**

The SNS-AT is freely available to any interested individual and is particularly suitable to both time- and resource-limited research on social media use behavior. Future studies using clinical samples, longitudinal, and cross-cultural designs are necessary to further consolidate the initial psychometric validation findings reported in the original study. Languages in which the test has been developed and/or translated to so far include:

* **[English :uk:](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-023-01342-9)**: Download  **[here](https://osf.io/vjwdf)**

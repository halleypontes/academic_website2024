**Abstract**
{style="text-align: center;"}

Background: Over the last decade, there has been growing concern about ‘gaming addiction’ and
its widely documented detrimental impacts on a minority of individuals that play excessively. The latest
(fifth) edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-5) included nine criteria for the potential diagnosis of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD)
and noted that it was a condition that warranted further empirical study. Aim: The main aim of this study 
was to develop a valid and reliable standardised psychometrically robust tool in addition to providing 
empirically supported cut-off points. Methods: A sample of 1003 gamers (85.2% males; mean age 26 years)
from 57 different countries were recruited via online gaming forums. Validity was assessed by confirmatory 
factor analysis (CFA), criterion-related validity, and concurrent validity. Latent profile analysis was also 
carried to distinguish disordered gamers from non-disordered gamers. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were 
performed to determine an empirical cut-off for the test. Results: The CFA confirmed the viability of 
IGD-20 Test with a six-factor structure (salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict
and relapse) for the assessment of IGD according to the nine criteria from DSM-5. The IGD-20 Test proved
to be valid and reliable. According to the latent profile analysis, 5.3% of the total participants were
classed as disordered gamers. Additionally, an optimal empirical cut-off of 71 points (out of 100) seemed 
to be adequate according to the sensitivity and specificity analyses carried. Conclusions: The present 
findings support the viability of the IGD-20 Test as an adequate standardised psychometrically robust tool
for assessing internet gaming disorder. Consequently, the new instrument represents the first step towards
unification and consensus in the field of gaming studies.

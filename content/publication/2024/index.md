**Abstract**
{style="text-align: center;"}

The relationship between Gaming Disorder (GD) and the experience of functional impairments 
has received considerable theoretical attention in the recent past and current diagnostic
approaches underscore the centrality of functional impairments as a requirement for GD diagnosis.
However, there is limited empirical evidence illuminating the interplay between GD and functional
impairments, particularly among specific vulnerable groups. The present study seeks to bridge this 
gap by investigating an English-speaking sample (_N_ = 5198) comprising an age- and gender-matched 
group of Professional Gamers (PG, _n_ = 2599) and Non-Professional Gamers (NPG, _n_ = 2599) sub-sampled 
from a larger sample of 192,260 individuals. The results revealed that PG were at a greater risk 
for GD compared to NPG as the prevalence rate of GD among PG (3.31%) was significantly higher and 
almost doubled that of NPG (1.73%), with PG further exhibiting higher overall GD symptom-load and 
weekly time spent gaming compared to NPG. Furthermore, PG reported experiencing significantly higher 
frequency of gaming-related functional impairments compared to NPG, with the in particular affected 
areas for both PG and NPG being _‘school and/or work’_, _‘physical health’_, and _‘family’_, with other key 
differences emerging in relation to other outcomes. Overall, the present findings show that not only 
GD symptom-load but also some functional impairment is higher in PG compared to NPG which highlights
the need to develop and support prevention and intervention strategies for this at-risk population.

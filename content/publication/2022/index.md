**Abstract**
{style="text-align: center;"}

Background: ‘Gaming Disorder’ (GD) is now an officially recognized mental health disorder according 
to the World Health Organization (WHO) framework while ‘Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) remains as
a tentative disorder as per the American Psychiatric Association (APA) framework. Although both GD 
and IGD reflect disordered gaming tendencies marked by excessive time spent gaming, little is known
about the extent to which too much time spent gaming becomes particularly problematic. Moreover, emerging
research has highlighted the need to further explore how both disordered gaming frameworks perform in 
the assessment and estimation of disordered gaming symptoms and related behaviors. Methods: The primary
aim of the present study was to shed light on the complex relationship between time spent gaming and 
disordered gaming and to provide prevalence estimates of disordered gaming across the WHO and APA frameworks.
This study adopted an online survey methodology and a cross-sectional design in a large sample of 123,262 
eligible gamers from 168 countries. Results: The results obtained indicated that the prevalence rate
of disordered gaming among the participants was smaller when assessed with the WHO framework (i.e., 1.96%)
in comparison to the APA framework (i.e., 4.97%). Additionally, the relationship between time spent gaming 
and disordered gaming varied, and disordered gaming was associated on average with 34.53 h of gaming a
week within the APA framework (i.e., with at least five criteria endorsed; higher gaming-time-averages 
for those endorsing more criteria) and an average of 40.13 h a week within the WHO framework (i.e., with all
criteria endorsed). Conclusions: The relationship between weekly time spent gaming and disordered gaming is
multifaceted and varies according to the diagnostic framework adopted. The results highlight the need for 
further refinement at the diagnostic level in regard to disordered gaming.

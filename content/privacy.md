## **Important Notice**
{{% callout warning %}}
The information provided in this page should be read as '_to the best of my knowledge_' 
and not as legal advice
{{% /callout %}}

## **Introduction**
This website was built with the intent to respect your digital rights and privacy. Because the website was developed using the free and open-access
framework **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, you can easily verify the privacy settings implemented here by inspecting the
**[GitHub repository](https://github.com/halleypontes/academic_website2024)** hosting this website.

By using and/or continuing to use this website, including providing any Personal Data to me, you accept and consent to the rights, obligations,
and practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## **Collection of Personal Data**
This website does not require you to identify yourself and does not actively collect any form of Personal Data from you as it was designed to be fully accessible and operational
without requiring you to provide any Personal Data. 

However, if you opt to contact me indirectly via email, you may end up revealing Personal Data, including but not limited to your **email address** and/or **name**. 
If you wish to contact me via email more privately, using end-to-end encryption, you are welcome to use my
**[PGP Public Key](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GYZNM1652C#C34xqQi4LYoU)** (fingerprint: DE26 2BED FB0D C0ED 97F7 DD95 234E 9809 AEDA EAC8).

Please note that you may also be indirectly sending Personal Data in case you contact me via any of the social media platforms I use. Any message sent and/or
Personal Data provided to me by you will be stored in the platform you have chosen to contact me.
In this case, please check the Privacy Policy of the service you used to contact me as it will likely differ from this Privacy Policy.

## **Use of Cookies, Trackers, and Web Analytics**
This website does not use **[cookies](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/)** nor does it require you to enable them in order to fully access its contents.

Web analytics are collected using [Pirsch Analytics](https://pirsch.io) in order to obtain insights into how the website is used. This helps gain a better understanding
of visitors' behaviours and interests, enabling better optimisation of the website.

[Pirsch Analytics](https://pirsch.io) is an [open-source](https://github.com/pirsch-analytics/pirsch) cookie-free web analytics software that was developed according to the
'Privacy by Design' principle and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR.
To analyse visitor flows, a hashing algorithm is used to generate a 16-digit number as the visitor ID when the page request is received. The input values are the IP address,
the user agent, the date and a salt.

The visitor's IP address is not persisted in whole or in part, and is completely anonymised and non-reversibly hashed. The inclusion of the date and the use of one
salt per website ensures that website visitors cannot be recognised for more than 24 hours and cannot be tracked across multiple websites. A rough localisation (country/city)
is performed via a locally integrated database.

## **Sharing of Personal Data**
Unless you contact me directly and provide some form of Personal Data, this website does not collect any form of Personal Data that I can share with other stakeholders and/or third parties.

Any message you send me by contacting me via email and/or social media will be kept confidential and not be shared with anyone unless you are explicitly informed otherwise and 
consent to it being shared.

## **Your right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)**
Based on the functionalities provided by this website and the current **[General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR) legislation](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/)**, you have the
right to request that any Personal Data you may have sent me when contacting me, to be deleted.

If you do not wish to send any Personal Data in the first place, please do not contact me. However, in case you do and also wish to exercise your right to erasure,
please send me an **[email](mailto:contactme@halleypontes.com)** requesting that any Personal Data that I may hold about you be deleted.

All data deletion requests will be taken seriously and complied with and your request will be fulfilled in due course if possible.
